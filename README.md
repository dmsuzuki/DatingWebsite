# Dating Web Site

### Tecnical Overview
The web page is constructed using HTML and CSS. 
Most of the HTML content are form elements. 
All the style parameters are handled in a style section, at the top of the same page. 

#### Interactive Features
Requirements: 

 1. When the mouse is moved over any label or input or select element, the text in that element is shown larger. When the mouse moves away from the element, the text returns to its normal size.

 2. Immediately after the user selects the image of his/her face, the image is shown in the web page. A small piece of JavaScript will be made available to you to help with this functionality. However, you are not expected to understand the JavaScript code at this stage in the course and should not create any further JavaScript for this assessment task.
